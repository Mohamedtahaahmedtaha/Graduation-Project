EyeEG project focused on utilizing artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) applications to implement fifth-generation (5G) communication technologies
Developing a Deep Learning Model for Reconstructing CMR Images from Retinal Images using an Image-to-Image Translator (CycleGAN) and Utilizing Reconstructed Images in a Deep Regressor to Estimate Left Ventricle Volume for the Prevention of Heart Failure.
The project was among 275 submissions from 29 countries, we won the 1st place.
The project is a smart watch that measures blood pressure, blood sugar, oxygen levels, and other features, all linked to a mobile application. Through this app, you can upload eye scan images. Using Cyclo-JAN, we convert the eye scans into their corresponding CMR images. Then, we combine the results with the initial data from the smart watch to create deep learning models such as ResNet 50 and VGG16. These models are used to measure the left ventricle volume, which ranges from 58 to 103 milliliters for women and from 62 to 120 milliliters for men. Based on the volume, we assess the likelihood of a heart attack. The project is based on a scientific research paper published in Nature magazine.
